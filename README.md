CRICKET-SCORER 
Technologies: Django, React, REST APIs, JavaScript, CSS, MySQL

Project Overview:
Cricket-Scorer is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to digitize cricket scoring, manage teams, and provide real-time match statistics, similar to popular platforms like CricHeroes. Built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend, the application allows users to create, manage, and track matches, teams, and player statistics.

Key Features:

Team Management:
Users can create teams, add or remove players, and manage team rosters efficiently. Each team has a detailed profile with player lists, win/loss records, and overall performance stats.

Player Management:
Individual players can be added or removed from teams with ease. The platform maintains comprehensive player profiles, including their runs scored, balls faced, wickets taken, strike rates, and economy rates over various matches.

Live Match Scoring:
The platform supports live scoring for cricket matches, allowing users to update the score ball by ball. Scorecards display real-time updates, including runs, wickets, overs, and individual player performances such as boundaries, dot balls, and wickets. Players' and bowlers' statistics are automatically updated after each match.

Match Summary and Insights:
After each match, users can view detailed scorecards showing batting and bowling stats. The platform automatically calculates match statistics, such as total runs, wickets, run rate, and individual player contributions.

Statistics Dashboard:
View and analyze team and player performance through detailed statistics. The dashboard displays individual player stats, team rankings, and overall match history, allowing users to track performances across multiple matches. Metrics include runs, wickets, averages, strike rates, and economy rates for each player.

Responsive Design:
The entire platform is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring an optimized experience across devices, allowing users to score and track games on both desktops and mobile devices.

Customizable Match Formats:
The platform allows users to score matches in various formats (T20, ODI, Test), providing flexibility for different match durations and formats.

Seamless User Experience:
The application offers an intuitive and professional user interface, making it easy for users to navigate between team management, scoring, and statistics pages.

Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained extensive experience in full-stack development, working with Django REST Framework to create secure APIs and React.js to build dynamic and interactive front-end components. The platform also enhanced my skills in handling real-time data updates, database management (using MySQL), and improving user experiences with modern web technologies like CSS Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.

Feel free to modify this description further, but it should now reflect a detailed and professional overview of your project, highlighting your technical skills and project management.
